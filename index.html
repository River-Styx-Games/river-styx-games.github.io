                    It's said the River Styx straddles the divide between the lands of the living and the dead.<br /><br />

                    Traversing its length, I hear bass-boosted bars ahead of me while, behind me, the living chase music and inspiration of all kinds.<br /><br />

                    Tonight, tomorrow, for days and weeks to come...  worlds collide.<br />

                        Alex is a typical slacker who's not really "going places," and even if he is, none of them are good. Tossed in jail one night after his
                        friends ditch him during a dumb caper, he's approached by a mischievous demon with an interesting pitch: sell his soul, and she'll break
                        him out. Not five minutes later, Alex is riding down the River Styx, the Underworld's newest denizen. What he doesn't realize is this
                        isn't the end of his problems; it's only the beginning. He meets Karen, who goes by "Demondice," the Underworld's number-one
                        fire-spitter and headliner at Satan's Rap Dungeon, and finds the Underworld is a pretty rowdy place, where bar fights and back-alley
                        brawls are the norm. After some run-ins with Karen's demonic detractors, Alex is contacted by a mysterious individual threatening to
                        expose a secret from his past, and he and Karen decide to team up. Also joined by Demon-chan, the supposed owner of Alex's sold soul,
                        they head back to the land of the living, set to encounter new friends and foes alike - rockers and hip-hoppers, jazzy cats and idols.

                        Muses of Mayhem: The Demondice Visual Novel is a fan project created by River Styx Games, a team comprising fans of the alt-/J-rapper 
                        Demondice. It is a strictly not-for-profit adaptation featuring characters that are not intended to be accurate reflections of real-life 
                        persons or personalities. Put another way, this is all for fun, so don't take it too seriously. A lot of effort was put into this with 
                        little to no budget or material support, however, so it is our sincerest hope that everyone enjoys it. Do note River Styx Games and Muses 
                        of Mayhem are in no way affiliated with Demondice/Karen, her management or colleagues, or associated acts.

                                    What's there to say? My name is 'Mike,' and I'm a four-time novelist, full-time amateur, and occasional screenwriter. Rumors
                                    of my employment by various three-letter agencies have been greatly exaggerated, though I've been known to cavort with
                                    cohorts in the five-O. Described as a madlad - or a mad genius, depending on who you ask - I write only after midnight,
                                    using a 1940s manual typewriter and typing with the muzzles of handguns duct-taped to me. (You may use your imagination
                                    figuring out how that works.) Setting aside my professional exploits, I'm a Dicecord OG, and you'll never convince me
                                    American Saikoro isn't Dice's masterpiece. Despite my many trips down the River Styx, I remain a bondservant of Christ and
                                    am blessed to be working with the very talented members of our dev team.

                                    Hello, I'm the one named DragonFox or Cross to my friends. I'm apart of the writing team as a side writer. I may not be the
                                    top listener of our Queen of the sadbois but I'm still here for the long-haul. Getting through day to day with a combination
                                    of spite and music, and ready to back up homies no matter what. Currently killing my ears with fat tracks playing loud,
                                    cramping hands with work, and burning my eyes on screens. Need a beta reader? Hit me up. Wanna trade music recs? I got you.
                                    Let's hit the ground running even if the worlds snuffing your fire, burn brighter and harder.

                                    Hey so I tried to write a rap verse for my blurb but like the others told me to make an actual blurb so uh here goes nothin'
                                    lol. I'm Treacle (or "Martyr" in raps (which I have nowhere near enough experience in to really be considered a rapper to
                                    any significant extent)). I'm into FPS games, D&D, listening to music, karaoke, and I used to watch anime. Idrk how to
                                    introduce myself lol. I guess I'll say that being a part of this process has been a cool experience, and I'm fortunate to
                                    have been a part of it and watch it unfold. Oh yeah, and go listen to Scott SK Miller's shit. Hit me up if you want recs.

                                    to semi-professionally for at least 10 years now, and I'm providing the Sprite art and Character design for this VN. With over a 
                                    month of consecutive listening-to of Karen's discography in the in 2021, I'm in her top 0,005% of listeners, which basically 
                                    translates to: "Holy shit she's my biggest inspiration." As a Dicecord OG, I'm also just super stoked to work on such an ambitious

                                    Fake Type is a big inspiration to me, so I'll be trying to capture the right feeling that inspired Demondice as well!<br /><br />

                                    than I am, but I've enjoyed being a part of overlapping communities such as Vocaloid, EDM, and J-pop. My hobbies include
                                    anything STEM/Business related, going out for boba, and annoying Jake. Currently, I'm studying Web3 and working towards a

                            Currently, this is the only place you can officially download the game. In the future, however, we plan to release it on platforms
                            such as itch.io, Steam and/or the Google Play Store. Until then, please download the game from here, and share the project with your
                            friends if you enjoy it!<br />

                                This is only the Deemo version of the game, there is no full release yet as we are still working on development. That said, it should still be bug-free and completely enjoyable! There are sample features that are not available in the prologue, but will be fully implemented in the full version, including the Gallery and the Store. If you find any bugs, please report them to us!

                            Installing and playing the game is easy! Just download the game from one of the two buttons above, right click the zip folder,
                            extract it, and run the file called <code>Muses of Mayhem.exe</code>. On some computers, the file may just be called
                            <code>Musesof Mayhem</code>, but either way, it should have an icon other than the standard Windows exe icon. Run that, and enjoy
                            the game!
